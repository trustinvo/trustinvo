# Trustin's Data Analytics

My name is Trustin. Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! I've had an interest in analytics since college and have then gained more experience with tools such as SQL and R to grow my skillset since. I'm currently a consultant at TheRealReal, where I have developed SQL queries to help make sense of business data. 
Here, I document and summarize my personal projects that utilize tools for data analytics.
